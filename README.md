### Working with logs checker: ðŸ§Š
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4217dc75-a212-4662-9f0b-db19307b37a4)


When you start the software, you will see a menu with settings Most of the descriptions here are clear. I will explain what may not be clear. Check ALL - Check all wallets that are available. The software will check all wallets in turn Wait for new logs. If you pour logs on redline - the software will check new logs on arrival. Logs must be unpacked! Find Seeds in txt files - Find Seed phrases in logs Metamask address limit - If enabled, if metamask has more than 10 addresses, it will check only the first 5 addresses. If disabled - it will check all addresses, but the check may take a long time. By standard - enabled.

### Brute Force Crypto Logs Button

The Brute Force Crypto Logs button initiates an automated attack to decrypt encrypted log files by systematically trying different password or key combinations. It is designed for security testing, password recovery, and cryptanalysis purposes. Users can configure attack parameters, monitor progress in real time, and adjust settings based on encryption complexity.

ðŸš¨ Note: Unauthorized use of brute force techniques may violate legal and ethical guidelines. Ensure proper authorization before proceeding.
